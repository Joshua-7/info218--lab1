 <h2>Errol Green</h2>
 <p>As seen above, my name is Errol Green. I am a student in his third year at
     the University of the West Indies. My hobbies include photography, 
     playing games and digital sculpting which I am still currently learning 
     how to do proficiently. I strive to either work as a computer scientist at Google
     or sculpt as an artist. I have little to no experience with front end development and 
     it is something that I have always been interested in. The possiblities when paired with 
     my sculpting or photography are endless and I would like to explore those possiblities.
     This is what lead me to do this course.
